Description:

This is a function at the heart of the OPUSMODUS realisations of interference techniques
found in the Schillinger System of Music Composition. This system, popular in the USA in
the mid 20C and studied by Gershwin and many lm composers, has been reassessed in
recent years by Dr Jeremy Arden.

Here is one of two methods of creating interference rhythms. Two sources of pulse are
required in both methods. For example 3:2 means a pulse travelling at frequency 3 units of
time (eg. seconds) synchronised with a pulse travelling at frequency 2 units of time. Notice
that the numbers in the ratio are only commonly divisible by 1 and are unequal.

Method 1

Example of (3 2) interference rhythm.

(* 3 2)      =   (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) -> total length
 2 (3)       =   (1   1   1) (1   1   1) -> (3 3)
 3 (2)       =   (1   1) (1   1) (1   1) -> (2 2 2)
result       =   (1   1) (1) (1) (1   1) -> (2 1 1 2)

In the above diagram the length of the rhythm is determined by the product of the two pulses
(3*2=6). The two pulses (3 2) begin and end together forming a cycle.

All rhythms generated by this method are repetitive. Each complete cycle is symmetrical
around its centre '(2 1 1 2). Schillinger suggests that symmetrical rhythms have
important musical qualities: economy, since one half generates the other, balance due to the
mirror symmetry and a quality Schillinger refers to as contrast, the difference between
successive numbers. In the method the contrast between the numbers is 2-1=1. The greater
the difference between numbers the greater the contrast.

Examples:

Here is a demonstration of how an interference list could be transferred to create phrases of
note length and note length rests.

(setf 7-is2 (interference2 '(4 3)))
=> (3 1 2 2 1 3))

Using the function GEN-LENGTH to make the conversion to lengths:

(gen-length 7-is2 8)
=> (3/8 1/8 1/4 1/4 1/8 3/8)

(gen-length 7-is2 16)
=> (3/16 1/16 1/8 1/8 1/16 3/16)

(gen-length 7-is2 '(8 16))
=> ((3/8 1/8 1/4 1/4 1/8 3/8) (3/16 1/16 1/8 1/8 1/16 3/16))

Now to add rest lengths into the rhythmic phrases. Note that series suggested in the rst
argument of LENGTH-REST-SERIES runs through the output lists:

(length-rest-series
 '(1 2 1 3 2 4) (gen-length 7-is2 '(8 16)))
=> ((-3/8 1/8 -1/4 -1/4 1/8 3/8) (-3/16 1/16 -1/8 1/8 1/16 3/16))

(length-rest-series
  '(1 2 1 3 2 4) (gen-length '(8 16) 7-is2 :repeat 2))
=> ((-3/8 1/8 -1/4 -1/4 1/8 3/8) (-3/8 1/8 -1/4 1/4 1/8 3/8)
    (-3/16 1/16 1/8 1/8 1/16 3/16) (3/16 1/16 1/8 1/8 1/16 3/16))
                                                                               fi
