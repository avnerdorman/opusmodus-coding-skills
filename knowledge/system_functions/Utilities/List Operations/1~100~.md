Opusmodus                                                                                 1~100~    1

1~ to 100~ sequence
[Function]

Arguments and Values:
sequence                   sequence of lists.


Description:

Use this function as an alternative to the Lisp primitive CAR or FIRST and its progeny ex.
CAAR, CAAAR etc… It may be used within the range 1 to 100.


Examples:
(setf seq '(c4 d4 e4 f4 g4))

(1~ seq)
=> c4

(2~ seq)
=> d4

(3~ seq)
=> e4

This utility function is invaluable for calling a sublist or section from within a list of lists.

(setf list '((c4 d4 e4 f4 g4) (a4 b4))

(1~ list)
=> (c4 d4 e4 f4 g4)

(2~ list)
=> (a4 b4)

In the preliminary example below a randomly generator list of integers has split up into motif
groups. The groups have then been re-arranged by collecting from odd and even counts of
the divided list.

(setf lis-i (gen-divide (rnd-sample 4 '(2 3 4 3)) (rndn 20 0 12)))
=> ((2 2 3 5) (8 8) (10 4 11)
    (4 6 8 9) (3 3 4 4) (2 5) (4))

(setf odd-l (append (1~ lis-i) (3~ lis-i) (5~ lis-i)))
=> (2 2 3 5 10 4 11 3 3 4 4)

(setf even-l (append (2~ lis-i) (4~ lis-i) (6~ lis-i)))
=> (8 8 4 6 8 9 2 5)

This is just one of many techniques that can be developed when seeking to compose with a
very limited source of thematic material.
