[shift-command-m]


Description:

To start the MIDI Entry into your score le, select the command MIDI Entry from the
Tools menu. When MIDI Entry is active a oating window will appear next to the Listener:




Depending on the position of the pitch-bend and the modulation wheel as well as the
position of the sustain pedal, the contents of the window will change. To make the MIDI
Entry as functional as possible there are a number of commands that will increase the speed
of your work without the need to move away form your MIDI keyboard. Every entry is
octave independent, except the pitch entry.
