Arguments and Values:

amplitude               a number representing the amplitude of the wave.
                        or a sequence serving as alternating amplitudes.

Description:

The HALF-SINE function generates a sequence of vectors that describe and simulate the
characteristics of a half sine wave.

First the GEN-SINE:

(list-plot (gen-sine 32 1 0.5) :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                     half-sine     2

Now the HALF-SINE:

(list-plot (half-sine 32 0.5) :join-points t)




With control over resolution (the length of the wave), frequency and amplitude (and
additional control over phase and modulation) this function can be a remarkably effective
tool for creating gestural forms in pitch, rhythm, dynamics and structure.


Examples:
(list-plot (half-sine 120 1.0 :phase 90) :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                  half-sine   3

In the example below the keyword :modulation is applied and its values are generated by
the GEN-SINE function.

(list-plot (half-sine 120 1.0 :phase 90
            :modulation (gen-sine 120 1 0.2))
 :join-points t)




In the example below the amplitude parameter '(0.5 0.2 0.1) has three values.
These represent a sequence of alternating amplitudes.

(list-plot (half-sine 120 '(0.5 0.2 0.1))
 :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                     half-sine     4

In this nal example the keyword :phase is used to produce a different start point (90) in
the 360 degree range.

(list-plot (half-sine 120 '(0.5 0.2 0.1) :phase 90)
 :join-points t)




In this nal example the GEN-SINE the amplitude values are generated by the HALF-
SINE function:

(list-plot (gen-sine 120 5 (half-sine 120 1.0 :phase 180))
 :join-points t)

Opusmodus                                                                   half-sine   5

(list-plot (gen-sine 120 5 (half-sine 240 1.0 :phase 180))
:join-points t)




Here below there's a clear example of how alternating amplitude values can affect the
wave output when the vectors are mapped to pitches.

 (vector-to-pitch
  '(g3 g5)
  (gen-sine 120 32 (half-sine 120 1.0 :phase 180))
 :join-points t :join-chords nil)
