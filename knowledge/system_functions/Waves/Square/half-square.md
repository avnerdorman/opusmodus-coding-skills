[Function]

Arguments and Values:
res                     resolution and length of the wave.
amplitude               a number representing the amplitude of the wave.
                        or a sequence serving as alternating amplitudes.
freq                    a number representing the frequency of the wave.
                        The default is 1.
phase                   a number representing the phase. The default is NIL.
modulation              if NIL no modulation, otherwise a wave. The default is NIL.


Description:

The HALF-SQUARE function generates a sequence of vectors that describe and simulate the
characteristics of a half square wave.

First the GEN-SQUARE:

(list-plot (gen-square 32 1 0.5) :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                     half-square   2

Now the HALF-SQUARE:

(list-plot (half-square 32 0.5)




With control over resolution (the length of the wave), frequency and amplitude (and
additional control over phase and modulation) this function can be a remarkably effective
tool for creating gestural forms in pitch, rhythm, dynamics and structure.


Examples:
(list-plot (half-square 120 1.0 :phase 45) :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                half-square   3

In the example below the keyword :modulation is applied and its values are generated by
the GEN-SQUARE function.

(list-plot (half-square 120 1.0 :phase 90
            :modulation (gen-square 120 1 0.7))
 :join-points t)




In the example below the amplitude parameter '(0.5 0.2 0.1) has three values.
These represent a sequence of alternating amplitudes.

(list-plot (half-square 120 '(0.5 0.2 0.1)) :join-points t)
Opusmodus                                                                   half-square     4

In this nal example the keyword :phase is used to produce a different start point (90) in
the 360 degree range.

(list-plot (half-square 120 '(0.5 0.2 0.1) :phase 90) :join-points t)




In this nal example the GEN-SQUARE the amplitude values are generated by the HALF-
SQUARE function:

(list-plot (gen-square 120 5 (half-square 120 1.0 :phase 180))
 :join-points t)

(list-plot (gen-square 120 5 (half-square 240 1.0 :phase 180))
 :join-points t)




Here below there's a clear example of how alternating amplitude values can affect the
wave output when the vectors are mapped to pitches.
